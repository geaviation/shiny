This is the Debian GNU/Linux r-cran-kernsmooth package of KernSmooth, a
collection of functions for kernel smoothing and density estimation 
written by M.P. Wand and M.C. Jones.

This package was created by Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>.
The sources were downloaded from 
	http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/contrib/
and are also included in the (large) source tar archive of R itself at
	http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/base/

The package was renamed from its upstream name 'KernSmooth to
'r-cran-kernsmooth' to fit the pattern of CRAN (and non-CRAN) packages
for R.
