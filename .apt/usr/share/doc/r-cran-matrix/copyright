This is the Debian GNU/Linux r-cran-matrix package of Matrix, a
package for GNU R providing dense and sparse matrix utilities for R.
This package was created by Douglas Bates <bates@debian.org> who is
also one of the principal authors. It is now maintained by Dirk
Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>.

The sources were downloaded from 
	http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/contrib/

The package was renamed from its upstream name 'Matrix' to
