This is the Debian GNU/Linux r-cran-spatial package of spatial, a package
providing functions and datasets for kriging and point-pattern analysis by
W. N. Venables and B. D. Ripley.

It has already been part of Debian since Dec 1997 as part of the
r-base package, and since Jan 2004 as part of the package bundle VR
packaged as r-cran-vr.

This package was created by Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>.
The sources were downloaded from the CRAN network at
	http://cran.r-project.org

The package was renamed from its upstream name 'spatial' to 'r-cran-spatial'
to fit the pattern of CRAN (and non-CRAN) packages for R.
