This is the Debian GNU/Linux r-cran-mass package of MASS, a package
providing functions and datasets supporting the Venables and Ripley
book 'Modern Applied Statistic with S' (4th ed.) written by
W. N. Venables and B. D. Ripley.

It has already been part of Debian since Dec 1997 as part of the
r-base package, and since Jan 2004 as part of the package bundle VR
packaged as r-cran-vr.

This package was created by Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>.
The sources were downloaded from the CRAN network at
	http://cran.r-project.org

The package was renamed from its upstream name 'MASS' to 'r-cran-mass'
to fit the pattern of CRAN (and non-CRAN) packages for R.
