This is the Debian GNU/Linux r-base package of the GNU R system for
statistical computing and graphics.

R has a home page at `http://www.r-project.org/'.  It is free software
distributed under a GNU-style copyleft, and an official part of the GNU
project ("GNU S").

This package was initially debianized by Douglas Bates bates@stat.wisc.edu on
Wed, 10 Dec 1997 14:17:31 -0600. 

Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org> currently maintaines the package.  

Sources were downloaded from http://cran.r-project.org/src/ and changes,
typically only to files in the debian/ directory are fully documented in the
file /usr/share/doc/r-base/changelog.Debian.gz.

R was initially written by Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka of the
Statistics Department of the University of Auckland.
Since mid-1997 there has been a core group with write access to the R
source, currently consisting of

R ships with the following file doc/COPYRIGHTS and refers to doc/COPYING, a 
copy of the GPL-2.

========= begin doc/COPYRIGHTS ==============================================

COPYRIGHT STATUS

The bulk of this code is copyright by members of or all of the R
Development Core Team.

See the file COPYING for the exact conditions under which you may
redistribute it.

The status of files used only in the Windows port is in file
src/gnuwin32/COPYRIGHTS.win, which is appended to this file in binary
Windows distributions.

	---------------------------------------------------

The some of the public header files are distributed under the more
permissive terms of the file COPYING.LIB.  This applies only to the
files

src/include/R.h
src/include/Rdefines.h
src/include/Rgraphics.h
src/include/Rinternals.h
src/include/Rmath.h
src/include/S.h
src/include/R_ext/*.h

From the announcement of the change (2001-Feb-05)

    It came to our attention that some projects are interpreting GPL to
    mean that compiling against the header files or linking against a
    Windows import library brings the compiled code under the scope of
    GPL.  This would mean it would be impossible to distribute binary
    versions of non-GPL packages with compiled code which called entry
    points in the R executable or DLL, of which there are many on CRAN.

    We encourage packages to be distributed under Open Source conditions,
    but accept that this is not possible for some contributions.  Our
    intention is that export files and import libraries be `accessors'
    under clause 5 of the LGPL, so that in most cases no (additional)
    restrictions are imposed by compiling a package using the LGPL-ed
    components of R.

    To avoid any anomalies, the versions of the same files in R versions
    1.0.0 to 1.2.1 may also be used under LGPL or GPL.

As from R 2.3.0 import libraries are no longer used under Windows, and
as from R 2.4.0 fewer export files are used under AIX.


Some contributed files are also covered by the Library General Public License.
These include (see also below)

src/library/stats/R/embed.R
src/library/stats/src/PPsum.c
