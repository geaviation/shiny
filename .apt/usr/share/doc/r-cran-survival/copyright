This is the Debian GNU/Linux r-cran-survival package of survival, a
collection of functions and datasets for survival analysis. Survival
was written by Terry Therneau, and ported to by Thomas Lumley.

This package was created by Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>.
The sources were downloaded from 
	http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/contrib/
and are also included in the (large) source tar archive of R itself at
	http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/base/

The package was renamed from its upstream name 'survival' to 'r-cran-survival'
to fit the pattern of CRAN (and non-CRAN) packages for R.
