This is the Debian GNU/Linux r-cran-nlme package of nlme, a collection
of functions to fit and compare linear and non-linear mixed-effects
models. Nlme was written by Jose Pinheiro, Douglas Bates, Saikat
DebRoy and Deepayan Sarkar.

This package was created by Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>.
The sources were downloaded from 
	http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/contrib/
and are also included in the (large) source tar archive of R itself at
	http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/base/

The package was renamed from its upstream name 'nlme' to 'r-cran-nlme'
to fit the pattern of CRAN (and non-CRAN) packages for R.
