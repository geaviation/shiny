This is the Debian GNU/Linux r-cran-boot package of boot, a collection
of functions and datasets for bootstrapping from the book "Bootstrap
Methods and Their Applications" by A. C. Davison and D. V. Hinkley
(1997, CUP).  The boot package was written by Angelo Canty.

This package was created by Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>.
The sources were downloaded from 
	http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/contrib/
and are also included in the (large) source tar archive of R itself at
	http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/base/

The package was renamed from its upstream name 'boot' to 'r-cran-boot'
to fit the pattern of CRAN (and non-CRAN) packages for R.
